# Hand Skeleton Real-Time Overlay

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Implementation of TensorFlowâ€™s hand pose detection model in a React/Javascript app
- Leveraged TensorFlow.js for its machine learning capabilities, enabling the model to run directly in the browser
without the need for server-side processing
- Developed a dynamic overlay that superimposes hand pose information onto live camera feed in real-time
using React components

## How to Use

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
